# ML.NET CLI Codespaces

Sample repo that shows how to configure the ML.NET CLI with GitHub Codespaces.

This uses the [.devcontainer.json](./.devcontainer.json) file to create an environment with .NET 6 SDK and ML.NET CLI.

Once the Codespace starts, it downloads the taxi-fare dataset.

From there, you can use the ML.NET CLI to train a regression model using the taxi-fare dataset.
